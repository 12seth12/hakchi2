This is mod for SNES Mini which moves your save-states data to unused partition of NAND flash.

This partition is only 50MB in size but it will free some space for games.

Please backup your save-states before using. I am not responsible for them.

## Please note

Each suspend point is on average around 2MB, if you make heavy use of the feature or have a lot of games, you may not have enough space for saves which will cause a C7 error.

If you experience any issues using this mod, it's recommended that you uninstall it. By moving your saves to the unused partition you run the risk of causing adverse effects to the set up of your mini.
